# Mojave 10.14.4 and above.

What works:
* Almost everything OOB with AMD GPU (Haven't noticed something that doesn't work that I need)
* Ethernet
* Sleep/Wake/Shutdown
* Native CPU powermanagement with i7-7700K and SMBIOS 18.3
* USB 3.0 works (Up to 480Mb/sec)
* USB 3.1 seems to work but I don't think it matches the max speed.

What does **NOT** work:
* Native motherboard Audio, but could be patched.
* IMessage or whatever, can be fixed.
